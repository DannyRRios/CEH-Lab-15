This is a screenshot of the final step I completed! 

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab was all about SQL injections and was pretty easy to perform. There were two tasks , one being the red side of it and then the blue side. For Task 1 we performed SQL injection attacks on a MSSQL database through windows and then switched to Linux to use the tool sqlmap. For the second task we detected SQL injection vulnerabilities using DSSS and OWASP ZAP.
